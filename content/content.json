      "Hey, I'm Deva - a software engineer and MS CS student at UMass Amherst, focusing on Machine Learning Systems, Distributed Systems, and high-performance backends. I care about making ML models not just accurate, but deployable, efficient, and scalable in the real world.",
      "Before grad school, I worked as a backend engineer, building APIs, data pipelines, and production systems. These days I'm deep into questions like: how do we train and serve models faster? how do we use resources smarter? how do we keep systems simple while everything around them gets more complex?",
      "Beyond code, I enjoy teaching and mentoring students, lifting at the gym, exploring photography and videography, and tinkering with photo/video editing. I'm also into psychology, stoicism, and how people interact with technology.",
      "I'm always up to collaborate on ML systems, backend optimization, and research-y projects around infrastructure and LLMs. Hit me up at <a href=\"mailto:devaanand@umass.edu\">devaanand@umass.edu</a> or <a href=\"mailto:devaags999@gmail.com\">devaags999@gmail.com</a>."
